# Sorting-Algorithms
The following file provides the algorithms for Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort & Quick sort

Selection sort algorithm:
  it has one single function "select_sort" which takes 3 arguments a, i, n and sorts the list in ascending order from index i to the end of the list
  'a' is the list that needs to be sorted.
  'i' is the index of the list from where the list needs to be sorted.
    if 'i' is provide with a value 0, then the entire list will be sorted in ascending order.
  'n' is the length of the the list 'a'
  time complexity is of O(n^2)

Insertion sort algorithm
  it has one single function "insert_sort" which takes 3 arguments a, i, n and sorts the list in ascending order from index i to the end of the list
  'a' is the list that needs to be sorted.
  'i' is the index of the list from where the list needs to be sorted.
    if 'i' is provide with a value 0, then the entire list will be sorted in ascending order.
